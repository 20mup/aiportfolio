# Mousa Pirzada — AI & Robotics Engineer 🚀  

Hi, I’m **Mousa Pirzada**, a Mechatronics & Robotics Engineering student at Queen’s University, passionate about **AI, robotics, and building things that actually matter**.  

This repo contains the source code for my **AI-powered portfolio** — a new way to tell my story.  
Instead of scrolling through static pages, you can **chat directly with my portfolio** to learn about my work, skills, and projects.

## 💡 Why This Portfolio?

I wanted a portfolio that reflects *how I actually think*.  
So instead of a static website, you get a **conversation**:  

- Recruiter? → Ask about my stack, results, and skills.  
- Engineer? → Ask for design choices, code, or technical breakdowns.  
- Curious friend? → Ask what I’m building right now.  

This is the **world’s first AI portfolio** — it adapts to your curiosity.
