# Mousa Pirzada — AI & Robotics Engineer 🚀  

Hi, I’m **Mousa Pirzada**, a Mechatronics & Robotics Engineering student at Queen’s University, passionate about **AI, robotics, and building things that actually matter**.  

This repository contains the code for my **personal AI-native portfolio** — an interactive experience I designed to tell my story in a way that reflects how I think, work, and build.

## 💡 Why This Portfolio?

Traditional portfolios feel static and one-dimensional. I wanted something that matches my approach to engineering — interactive, intelligent, and adaptive.

Here, instead of scrolling through pages, you can have a **conversation with my portfolio**:
- Recruiter? → Ask about my stack, results, and skills.  
- Engineer? → Ask for design choices, code, or technical breakdowns.  
- Curious friend? → Ask what I’m building right now.  

This portfolio is built for me, by me — a reflection of my work and vision.
